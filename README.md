# informacoes-do-wikipedia
Search for information with the Python language and the wikipedia library and made the interface with the QT Designer tool.

The objective of this project is to make any search for information that has wikipedia. Like, for example, Neymar, will get all the information about Neymar from wikipedia.

### Why?

Just to practice my Python skills more
